A bash-script based Powerline style prompt for your shell
=========================================================

A [Powerline](https://github.com/Lokaltog/vim-powerline) like prompt for Bash using bash scripts

This implementation was inspired by [Powerline-Shell](https://github.com/banga/powerline-shell).
But that version, which is based on python, was exceedingly slow for my taste, taking upto 1.5
seconds for the shell prompt to be set with the python script. Hence, I decided to recreate the
appearance created in that prompt using only shell scripts.

Consequently this is not nearly as readily configurable as python based one above. However, with
a little bit of effort and knowledge of shell scripts, you can make this look however you desire.

### Main Features

* Shows time, hostname, current directory, and prompt
* Optional segments for number of background jobs,  read-only status of current directory, return
  code for last command if exited in failure along  with color change of the prompt to red
* Segment that shows current git branch if in a git repository, and number of modified, staged
  and conflicted files in the git repository.

### Unicode symbols used

* Number of background jobs: `⏎` followed by number
* Read-only status of current directory: ``
* Return code from previous bash command: `⚑`
* Git branch: ``
* Number of modified files in git repo: `✚`
* Number of staged files in git repo: ``
* Number of conflicted files in git repo: `✘`

In addition, the following symbols are used to separate different segments: , 

# Setup

* This shell script heavily relies on ANSI color codes to display colors in the terminal window.
  They may not be portable, hence it may not work for you out of the box. You may need to set
  your $TERM to `xterm-256color`.

* In addition, Unicode symbols require a special font to be used in your terminal. Please use
  one of the powerline fonts available at: https://github.com/Lokaltog/powerline-fonts

  * The "DejaVu Sans Mono for Powerline" font seems to be one of the better fonts for Unicode support.

* You may need to use `uxterm`, the XTerm with unicode support, in place of `xterm` if the
  Unicode characters are not correctly rendered.

* This script uses the `__git_ps1` command to identify if a directory is a git repository, and if
  it is, identify the branch name. If you do not have this command, please install it for your system.

* Clone this repository, or copy the `ps1_prompt` shell script to a suitable location. Let us assume
  that you placed this in your home directory.

* In your `.bashrc` or `.profile`, whichever is used, source the `ps1_prompt` script as follows:

```
source ~/ps1_prompt
```

# Customization

At this point, this script has no simple option for customization apart from manually editting
the script to your liking. Once you get the flow of the script, and after familiarizing yourself
with the ANSI color codes, it should be fairly straightforward to enhance the script to your taste.

Some resources that can help you with tweaking the script:

* [Bash tips: Colors and formatting (ANSI/VT100 Control sequences)](https://misc.flogisoft.com/bash/tip_colors_and_formatting)
* [ANSI color codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code#Colors): Color codes for the xterm/uxterm.
* [UTF-8 Unicode test documents](https://github.com/bits/UTF-8-Unicode-Test-Documents.git): Use the test documents in this repo to see what symbols are rendered using your chosen font.
* [PS1 cheat sheet](https://ss64.com/bash/syntax-prompt.html): Prompt variable characters for customizing the output of the PS1 prompt.
